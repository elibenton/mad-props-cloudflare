				A non-partisan, not-too-serious voter guide to the California ballot measures.
			</p>
			<p className='text-sm px-4 py-1'>
				Every two years, Californians get the distinct pleasure of voting on ballot
				propositions. 26 states have them, but nowhere are they more celebrated or more reviled
				than in the Golden State.
			</p>
			<p className='text-sm px-4 py-1'>
				Propositions can often seem ludicrous (remember the condom prop in 2016?). They can
				often feel antiquated (apparently slavery is on the ballot this year?). And they often
				are written to be as confusing as possible.
			</p>
			<p className='text-sm px-4 py-1'>
				This year there are 10 statewide propositions for your voting pleasure, and local
				propositions in most major cities across California. They run the gamut: schools,
				climate change, affordable housing, prescription drugs, factory farming, and more!
